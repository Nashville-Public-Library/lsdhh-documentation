# Content Types

Content Type  |  Description
---------- | -------------
Admin Landing Page    | The content type used to create the State Admin Landing Page. This content type is only used for one node. Has custom fields and permissions so only admins can view it. 
Announcement          | These are supposed to be visible on the home page of the LSDHH website. However, when published, they do not appear on the home page. Are these broken? Not in use? 
Article*              | I don't think we use this content type on the LSDHH site. 
Assistive Device*     | Not sure if this is in use. 
Event                 | Event listing for the LSDHH calendar or for state-page calendar listings. Event details includes geo-location informatoin in order to plot the event location on a map. Map is dislayed at the bottom of each event node. 
Feed*                 | Subscribe to RSS or Atom feeds. Creates nodes of the content type "Feed item" from feed content. This is NOT part of the Content menu. Not sure where these are created or used. 
Feed item*            | This content type is being used for automatically aggregated content from feeds. This is NOT part of the Content menu. Not sure where these are created or used. 
Helpful Links Page	  | A page of "Helpful Links", grouped by categories. 
Home Page Slide	      | Use to create home page slides for state pages. Slides can be displayed on multiple states. Each node is a slide on the state page slider. 
Job Posting	          | Create a job posting for your organization. Job postings are tagged with state(s) and are displayed on state pages. 
Knowledge Base Item*  | Not sure if this is in use.
Licensure*	          | Licensure by state for interpreters and transliterators. This is NOT in use on the site. The Licensure content has been disabled and a Rabbit Hole redirect takes them to the National Search. 
Material*	          | Seems related to the library catalog, but can't tell what these are or where they go.  
Page*	              | Use basic pages for your static content, such as an 'About us' page. Page is not listed in the Content menu. Not sure where those are created and by whom. 
Resource	          | Create a Resource listing to be included in the National Resource Website. Resources are tagged with categories.  
Site Wide Alert	      | Site Wide Alert links to notify of location closures, etc. Not sure if these are displayed on all pages or if they can be customized and only shown on specific states. 
Splash*	              | Use splash content for pages that should have a minimal theme. There are only 5 nodes created with this content type. Not sure if this content type is used to make new content.   
Webform	              | Create a new form or questionnaire accessible to users. Submission results and statistics are recorded and accessible to privileged users. Only available to site admin. 
YouTube Video	      | Use to add a YouTube video to the site. Videos are tagged by video type so they display in the correct place. 

## Additional Notes

- Expand all button on the "create resource" form is a special feature built with JavaScript. To "exapnd all" had to touch every part of the form which wasn't posssible without the custom JavaScript. **Put in content type notes?**
