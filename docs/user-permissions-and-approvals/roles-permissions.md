### Content Contributer Roles

Library Staff (NPL Staff)
   - Able to create new home page slides, new pages, new site wide alerts.
   - Able to manage home page slides, pages, and site wide alerts. 
   - Able to edit anyone's events, home page slides, pages, resources, and webforms. 
   - The Library Staff role was made b/c staff were publishing things and making mistakes. So Sandy wanted to restrict the ability to publish. 

Anyone who registers for the Ask Sandy site using the online registration form is automatically granted the following roles:
- Resource Service Provider
- Event Admin
- Job Recruiter

These roles can create new content or edit their own content. They cannot publish any content. All submitted content must be reviewed and approved by a higher-level role. 

### Authenticated Users

Is this basically the same level as service provider, event admin, and recruiter? Does this role have any permissions if this is the only box checked? Or can you just log in but not see anything? 

### Anonymous Users

These are general users who visit the site. They can access published content. Tehy can also use the anonymous submission form to submit resources for review **(or I think they can -- can't find the form)**

### Content Approval Bypass Roles

These roles can log in and submit content that is immediately published. Content by these roles does not need moderation. 

- Ask Sandy: **Nick will look at notes to see if we still use this role.**

- Approval Bypass: Fixes some “troublesome issues.”  
    - Can edit content without notifiying content creator when changes are made.
    - Can post content without approval. 

## FAQs

### Who can make content live? 

The only roles that can make content live on the site are:
- Library Admin (NPL)
- Library Editor (NPL)
- State Resource Admin (NOT NPL)

All other roles can create content, but that content must be approved by the above three roles. 
 

Currently, Sandy is editing everything that is getting submitted to the site b/c each listing has so many errors. The plan is for State Admins to take over Sandy’s role of reviewing all the content and publishing.
