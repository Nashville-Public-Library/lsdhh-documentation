# Moderation Workflow

## Claiming Resources

There's a system of "claiming" resources. This isn't like Wikipedia where every logged in user can edit content. You have to be an owner of the resource to edit it. 

1. If you're the authorized signature on a resource, you can claim ownership and immediately take ownership of a resource.

1. If you're not the authorized signature on a resource, you can claim a resource, but you don't take ownership immediately. Your request goes to an approval process and must be approved by an admin. 

## Locked Resources

In order to avoid collisions where two people are editing the same resource at the same time, resources become locked when the creator is editing. An admin can break the lock. Content editor can also break the lock. Lock expires after 15 minutes. 

## Message Center

Users have a message center tab on their profile page. This is a complex custom feature that replicate messages being sent to state admins by email. Users can define messaging preferences: 
- Get emails as they're sent.
- Get emails in a digest format each day or week.

Messages have links to view or approve content or message the user who submitted the content. 

State admins can see the entire history of who has updated the resource node. They can go into any point in the history and email the owner of the node. 

A tab /button will be added to the state admin profile to "message a user" so they do not have to find a user in the message history. 

## Moderation for Updated Resources / Events / Job Listings

Job posting example: 
- Submit for approval.
- Approved.
- Updated so it goes back into approval. Users can still see the approved version that got published. But they cannot see the submitted changes while they are pending approval.
- Udpates approved. User can now see the post with the updated information.
