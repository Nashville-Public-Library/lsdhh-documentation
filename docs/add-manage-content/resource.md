## Form Details

Info below highlights unique parts of form fields only.

1. Main Info > Organization / Business: This field has a special function to reduce duplicates. Start typing a word and there's a dialog box that lists possible duplicate content. 

1. Event Location > Location Type: 
    1. The location type determines what flag shows up next to an event. There's a custom module that affects how the form works (which things are required or not). 
    1. Selecting "physical" is what makes a map be displayed on a resource page. 
    1. Physical: If physical, required to give a state. Can also add mailing address. 
    1. Virtual: If only virtual, state still required. But address is not asked. 
    1. National: If national, state is not required. 
    1. All: No state is required.  

1. Event Location > County: County is there because some resources in TN are only available in certain counties. They have future plans to allow users to look for resources within a certin proximity to a county. 

1. Event Location > Region: Currently only regions in TN. 

1. Convert to Profile: This makes a resource node take on the appearance of a profile page. Sandy wanted simple resources to become their own website. So, instead of looking and acting like all other resource pages, the resource would end up with a new theme and new functionality (kind of like making a Facebook page). Once you convert a resource to a profile you cannot change it back. 

1. Authorization info: 
    1. Set the state of ownership, like which state admins can manage the resource. 
    1. Authorization signature is not necessarily the person who is adding the resource. It refers to the person who is in charge of getting the resource added. For example, an intern might add the resource for Sandy (boss), but Sandy is the authorizing person. This allows Sandy to easily claim the resource later.
