# Content Management Overview

The LSDHH site has two purposes: 
- Be the Tennessee statewide library for deaf and hard of hearing. 
- Host the National Hearing Loss Resource Website (Ask Sandy). 

There are two different user groups for editing: 
- LSDHH staff manage site content for the TN Deaf Library. 
- Non-library staff add, approve, and administer resources and state pages.
