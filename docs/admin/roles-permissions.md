# Roles / Permissions

## Anonymous Users

These are general users who visit the site. They can access published content. Tehy can also use the anonymous submission form to submit resources for review **(or I think they can -- can't find the form)**

## Authenticated Users

Is this basically the same level as service provider, event admin, and recruiter? Does this role have any permissions if this is the only box checked? Or can you just log in but not see anything? 

## Content Contributer Roles

Anyone who registers for the Ask Sandy site using the online registration form is automatically granted the following roles: service provider, event admin, recruiter. All submitted content must be reviewed and approved by a higher-level role.
